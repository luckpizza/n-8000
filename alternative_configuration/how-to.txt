Making changes in the kernel configuration


Please before reading this how-to, take a look at the one for building a kernel with the default configuration. it contains the basic step to build a kernel

1. Configuring the kernel
 You can find the new configuration for the built kernel in ./configuration/.config
 To build this configuration, we build and execute the menuconfig by doing in the kernel directory
    "make menuconfig"
  after this, one by one you should search the different configurations using the "/" shortcut to search in the menu.
  After finding each of them, I add them with the "*" (this is done, pressing the "space bar" over the feature you want to add). The kernel I downloaded, didn't have 2 configurations, which I left out, those arer:
    
    CONFIG_CGROUP_MEM_RES_CTLR_SWAP
    CONFIG_SECURITY_FILE_CAPABILITIES

2. Compiling 
  When compiling again with
     "make" 

3. TroubleShooting 

  it may show some configuration errors, for example I got:

    arch/arm/mvp/commkm/check_kconfig.c:74:2: error: #error "MVP not tested with migration features other than CONFIG_MEMORY_HOTPLUG and CONFIG_COMPACTION"
    make[2]: *** [arch/arm/mvp/commkm/check_kconfig.o] Error 1
    make[1]: *** [arch/arm/mvp/commkm] Error 2
    make: *** [arch/arm/mvp] Error 2

  This can be solve changing the configuration 
      # CONFIG_VMWARE_MVP=y
  To
      # CONFIG_VMWARE_MVP is not set

  after all this change, the kernel compiles correctly with all the modules
