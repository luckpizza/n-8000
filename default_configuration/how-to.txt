Compiling n-9000 kernel

1. Getting the source code 

  In order to compile a n-900 kernel you need download the source code from samsung website from: http://opensource.samsung.com/reception/receptionSub.do?method=search&searchValue=N8000

  There you will find many different source codes zipped, download the last one and proceed. 

  This Tutorial was made using the code from the revision GT-N8000_JB_Opensource_Update3.zip
  Unzip it to a folder, where inside you will find a Kernel.tar.gz  file containing the hole source code of the kernel

  Create the directories to work in: 
    "mkdir ~/n-9000 "
    "mkdir ~/n-9000/kernel "


  copy the Kernel.tar.gz there 
     "cp <UNZIPPED_PATH/Kernel.tar.gz ~/n-9000/kernel/"
  un-tar it
     "cd ~/n-9000/kernel"
     "tar -zxvf Kernel.tar.gz "

2. Getting the right gcc toolchain

  Now we need a gcc toolchain to compile the kernel for ARM

  Download prebuilt gcc toolchain for cross compiling:
   "cd .."
   "git clone https://android.googlesource.com/platform/prebuilt"

  for more information about it, please visit http://source.android.com/source/building-kernels.html

3. Configuring everything

  now we need to configure the compiler and toolchain we just downloaded to be used to compile the kernel. To do that execute:
  if  you are using Mac OSX:
      "export CROSS_COMPILE=~/n-9000/prebuilt/darwin-x86/toolchain/arm-eabi-4.4.3/bin/arm-eabi-" 
  or 
     "export CROSS_COMPILE=~/n-9000/prebuilt/linux-x86/toolchain/arm-eabi-4.4.3/bin/arm-eabi-" 
  if using linux

  now you only need to configure the kernel we are going to build:
     "cd ~/n-9000/kernel"
     "export ARCH=arm"
     "make p4notepq_00_defconfig"

4. Building the kernel
  Finally build it!
     "make"

  after a cupple of minutes, you will have your kernel 
     "arch/arm/boot/zImage "

5. Troubleshooting 

  if you experience some issues while compiling, please try downloading the patch from 
  https://github.com/luckpizza/n-8000/blob/master/default_configuration/patches/recordmcount.patch
  copy it to the kernel source dir and execute
     "patch scripts/recordmcount.old.c recordmcount.path "
  This is a temporally workaround till a real patch is submitted
